# Ball_Balancing_with_PID
This project is inspired by the introduction of Control Engineering (Control System). This Project will give the practical knowledge in closed loop system. It uses PID (Proprotional-Integral-Derivative) Controller to balance the ball in center.

The Updated_code_of_ball_balancing is working. For circuit connection click
